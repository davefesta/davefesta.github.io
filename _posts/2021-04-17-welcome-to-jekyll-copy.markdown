# Avoiding Common Product Feedback Issues

![Cover](/assets/workcover.png)

Achieving product-market fit depends in no small part on holding productive user feedback sessions with early adopters. We all know talking to users is great. Even greater if you're mindful of the following five "gotchas" I've run into first-hand in building b2b products.

## 1) Leading Questions

Asking broad, open-ended questions can become awkward, particularly if you have a strong inkling about the response. Bite your tongue. The problem with suggesting or angling towards a certain answer is that it becomes too easy for your audience to nod along. As obvious as it sounds, our goal is to hear direct, unbiased responses from our audience. That's the point of this exercise in the first place; so, let their voices shine!

## 2) Not grounding in use cases

Interesting ideas often pop up in conversation. "This would be cool..." or "It would be great if..." However, a clear persona and use case in mind is essential to stay on track. Without this in mind it's too easy to bounce around on interesting but not so critical features. our audience will not be clearly well-versed or organized in the problem we're solving and whats' essential. as a result it's often more productive to steer the conversation or at least parse the dialogue with the use cases in mind to stay focused.  

## 3) Over-indexing on one Customer

## 4) Being too general

ensure he’s prepared

get specifics on anecdotes

dont ask u want x or y he’ll say yes to everything

find key points in user journey so not throwing random features

build market not 1 user.

align internal up next

ask SPECIFICS NOT GENERAL HEY EVEYRHING
