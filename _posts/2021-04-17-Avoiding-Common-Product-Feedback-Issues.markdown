Achieving product-market fit depends in no small part on holding productive user feedback sessions with early adopters. We all know talking to users is great. Even greater if you're mindful of the following five "gotchas" I've run into first-hand in building b2b products.

## 1) Leading Questions

Asking broad, open-ended questions can become awkward, particularly if you have a strong inkling about the response. Bite your tongue. The problem with suggesting or angling towards a certain answer is that it becomes too easy for your audience to nod along. As obvious as it sounds, our goal is to hear direct, unbiased responses from our audience. That's the point of this exercise in the first place; so, let our users' voices shine without first nudging them toward a particular response!

## 2) Not grounding in Use Cases

Interesting ideas often pop up in conversation. "This would be cool..." or "It would be great if..." However, having a clear persona and use case in mind is essential to stay on track. Without this foundation, it's too easy to bounce around on interesting but not so critical features. Our users will not be clearly well-versed or organized in the problem we're solving and what is essential. As a result it's often more productive to steer the conversation or at least parse the dialogue with clear use cases in mind.

## 3) Over-indexing on One Customer

Assuming our goal is a scalable SaaS product we clearly we don't want to build custom software that will only work for one given customer. This is admittedly a delicate balance. On the other end of the spectrum is software that's too watered down or stuck in a lowest-common denominator that is so-so for everyone but not great for any one customer. The key is unpacking nuanced specific customer needs versus broader market value.

## 4) Not Enough Specifics

It's powerful to push, whenever possible, for recent anecdotes and stay out of too many hypotheticals. 

ensure he’s prepared

get specifics on anecdotes

dont ask u want x or y he’ll say yes to everything

find key points in user journey so not throwing random features

align internal up next

ask SPECIFICS NOT GENERAL HEY EVEYRHING
