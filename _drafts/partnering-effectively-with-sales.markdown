Working with sales is extremely important to get right for a given product to be successful. . They have a wealth of first-hand knowledge around prospective customers and the market. They understand clearly competition.  

Achieving product-market fit depends in no small part on holding productive user feedback sessions with early adopters. We all know talking to users is great. Even greater if you're mindful of the following five "gotchas" I've run into first-hand in building b2b products.

## 1) Leading Questions

Asking broad, open-ended questions can become awkward, particularly if you have a strong inkling about the response. Bite your tongue. The problem with suggesting or angling towards a certain answer is that it becomes too easy for your audience to nod along. As obvious as it sounds, our goal is to hear direct, unbiased responses from our audience. That's the point of this exercise in the first place; so, let our users' voices shine without first nudging them toward a particular response!

## 2) Not Grounding in Use Cases

Interesting ideas often pop up in conversation. "This would be nice..." or "It would be great if..." However, having a clear persona and use case in mind is essential to stay on track. Without this foundation, it's too easy to bounce around on interesting but not so critical features. Our users will not be clearly well-versed or organized in the problem we're solving and what is essential. As a result it's often more productive to steer the conversation or at least parse the dialogue with clear use cases in mind.

## 3) Over-indexing on One Customer

Assuming our goal is a scalable SaaS product we clearly we don't want to build custom software that will only work for one given customer. This is admittedly a delicate balance. On the other end of the spectrum is software that's too watered down or stuck in a lowest-common denominator that is so-so for everyone but not great for any one customer. The key is unpacking nuanced specific customer needs versus broader market value.

## 4) Not Enough Specifics

It's powerful to push, whenever possible, for recent anecdotes and stay out of too many hypotheticals. The ideal flow is typically starting high level before then zooming in. This also helps avoid the trap of conflating the "ideal self" versus reality.   Hypotheticals or generalized thoughts can often differ widely than what really has or is happening. Getting to the right level of specificity ensures a tight fit between the solution and need.
